## Description

employeeDirectory

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## 🚀 How to Use?

- Once the repository is cloned run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- The application will be invoked by running the following command in the terminal: `npm start`
- if running locally, navigate to your browser if not already open and put this url 'http://localhost:3000/' into the url address bar to find yourself on the react employee directory app.
